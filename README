This control allows you to copy a string value to the clipboard on mousedown/click. This utilizes the Zeroclipboard library that can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/zeroclipboard/wiki/Instructions

There are 4 things that you need to know to use this control:

1. Support files 

This control needs the corresponding support files from Zeroclipboard in order to work. You can get these support files through this link: http://code.google.com/p/zeroclipboard/downloads/list

2. Setting movie path

This path needs to point to the location of "ZeroClipboard.swf", one of the support files described above. You would need to change the path value that's defined in the code. You can find this code inside the function that handles the afterrender event. 

            ex. ZeroClipboard.setMoviePath(YourPath);

3. Initialization

You can initialize this control the same way you would initialize any other control. 

           {
                xtype: 'aol-copybutton',
                ref: '../../myCopyButton',
                copyText: 'Copy',
                width: 50
            }

           - OR -

            var myCopyButton = new AOL.form.CopyButton({
                ref: '../../copyLeadbackButton',
                copyText: 'Copy',
                width: 50
            });

4. Defining the string value to copy. 

You would probably need to define this on a certain event.

             ex.   myCopyButton.setValueToCopy("value");
